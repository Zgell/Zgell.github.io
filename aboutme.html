									<h3 class="major">Who Am I?</h3>
									<p>My name is Zgell, and I've always been interested in computers and electronics. I'm a computer programmer, an electronics hobbyist and an engineering student. Throughout my whole life I've always had a lot of fun with designing things, whether they were computer programs to automate tasks, or crazy ideas for fun electronic devices. Over the years I've taken the time to learn and acquire skills pertaining to these areas of interest so that I can work on some of these projects.</p>

									<p>I've created the website that you're on right now for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I wanted to create a place where I could document all of the information relating to the projects that I have worked on throughout the years. I've come up with a lot of projects and I have done a lot of work for those projects as well. I would like to organize a system of information that allows me to have all information about all of my previous, current and future projects so that I can revisit them easily any time I wish. Secondly, I want this website to act as a sort of portfolio. Since I'm going to make the information about my projects public, this website will end up serving as a portfolio of all of the work I have done over the years for those who are interested.</p>
