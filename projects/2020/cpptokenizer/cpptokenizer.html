									<h3 class="major" id="intro">Introduction</h3>
									<p>The story for this project begins on July 4th, 2020. A friend of mine introduced me to a concept in programming that I had never heard of called "esoteric programming languages". I'd explain it further, but I feel like the official definition listed on Wikipedia does it best:</p>
									<blockquote>An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.</blockquote>
									<p>In a nutshell, an esoteric programming language is just a really bizarre programming language. The reason these stuck out to me is because I had always thought about how making my own programming language would be a really cool project in the future, but I felt like I was never ready enough to take on such a task. However, after digging into esoteric programming languages a bit and getting a much better understanding of what a programming language can be, I figured that it wouldn't be impossible for me to try my hand at such a language.</p>
									<p>Originally, an esoteric language was going to be my project for July of 2020, but as you might be able to imagine, it's pretty difficult to plan out, code, test and finish an entire programming language within the span of a month (even if it's a relatively simple one). I really wanted to do something creative with the structure of the language, and as a result I became really indecisive with how I was going to structure the language. That is why this month's project is something as small as a tokenizer algorithm and not a big and grand project like a programming language. This tokenizer that I am writing about today was a piece of my currently unfinished language's interpreter (yes, it was meant to be an interpreted language, not a compiled one).</p>
									<p>Anyways, the goal of this little script is to take in a string of text as a source, along with another string of operators (known as the <i>deliminators</i>) to create a vector of strings that are split based on the deliminators. These strings are called <i>tokens</i>, hence why the algorithm is a "tokenizer". This is a necessary component of the language interpreter as it allows me to take in a line of the code, split it up by some arbitrary syntax and then have a much easier time interpreting the code and performing the corresponding actions.</p>

									<h3 class="major" id="breakdown">Algorithm Breakdown</h3>
									<a href="https://pastebin.com/SP5v8zS6" target="_blank">Here is a link to the full code file that I will be breaking down below.</a>
									<p></p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>At the top of the file, we have all of the things that need to be imported for the function to work. <code>iostream</code>, <code>vector</code> and <code>string</code> are pretty straightforward given that the function needs to be able to take information in and also display it, as well as it needs to take strings as inputs and produce a vector of strings as the output.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
#include &lt;iostream>
#include &lt;string>
#include &lt;vector>
#include &lt;algorithm>
#include &lt;cmath>
											</code></pre>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
std::string charToString(char x) { //Found on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-a-single-character-to-string-in-cpp/
	std::string s(1, x);
	return s;
}
											</code></pre>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>This is a simple function I created with the sole purpose of converting a single character into a string. I created this because when I needed to add characters to the final vector, I needed everything to be in the correct data type since you can't have a vector of both characters and strings. As seen by the comment in the code, I found the solution to my problem online, as I wasn't familiar with this method in C++ for creating a string from a character variable.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>The next section is the big part of the code, so I'm going to take it step-by-step so you have a good understanding of the thought process behind this algorithm.</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>As I stated above in the introduction, the variable takes in two inputs: the source, and the deliminators. The reason the source string is called "equation" is because I was originally using this algorithm to solve mathematical equations in my interpreter. However, it can be used for other purposes as well. Anyways, the function produces a vector of strings, which are all of the keywords, or <i>tokens</i>.</p>
											<p>The two variables being created as soon as the function is called are important as well. The first one is an empty vector that will later be filled up and returned as the result of the function. The string called "number" is used in the process of differentiating regular characters and deliminators. This will make sense a little bit later.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
std::vector<std::string> Tokenize(std::string equation, const std::string delim) {
	std::vector<std::string> tokens; //The result that will be returned
	std::string number; //A block of memory used for creating multi-digit numbers
											</code></pre>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
//Step 1: Compute number of operators in equation, preallocate space to "tokens".
int delimcount = delim.length(); //Number of operations to search for 
int opcount = 0; //Total number of all operator types
for (int i = 0; i < delimcount; i++) { //For each type of deliminator...
	opcount += std::count(equation.begin(), equation.end(), delim[i]); //Count how many delims are present and add them to the sum
}
tokens.reserve((2 * opcount) + 1);
											</code></pre>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>This is the first main step of the algorithm. Firstly, it sets up two more variables that are important. The first one is simply an integer that holds the number of different deliminators being entered into the equation. Since this value is a constant, it makes more sense to save it to an integer so that the <code>length</code> function isn't called as much for the sake of efficiency. The other variable is used to sum up the number of occurrences of each type of deliminator in the source string. This is to give the algorithm a sense for how large the resultant vector will be before we actually start filling it up. The <code>for</code> loop simply computes this value manually.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>Finally, once we have computed the sum of all deliminator occurrences, we reserve an amount of space in the resultant vector equal to two times the number of occurrences plus one. This specific value again ties into the fact that this function was originally used for mathematical equations. Since these equations didn't have operators on the edges of the equation (as that would be an incomplete equation), I knew that the number of numbers in the equation must be equal to the number of operators plus one. Therefore, the sum of all tokens should in theory add up to two times the number of deliminators plus one. This isn't always true for non-equation inputs, and as a result they can sometimes be slower than equations in certain cases.</p>
										</div>

											<img src="operatorexplanation.jpg" width="600">
											<p style="font-size:15px">A visual explanation of what I'm trying to describe with the relationship between the number of operators and the number of preallocated spaces in the vector. This relationship isn't necessarily true for text sources (as opposed to equation sources) and as such can cause slowdowns. However, this can be easily fixed by changing the value to add one extra space.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
//Step 2: Start splitting up the equation into pieces.
int eqlength = equation.length();
for (int i = 0; i < eqlength; i++) { //For each character in the equation...
	if ((std::count(delim.begin(), delim.end(), equation[i]) == 0) && (i != (eqlength - 1))) { //If the character is NOT a deliminator...
		number.append(charToString(equation[i])); //Add number to the "number box"
	}
	else if ((std::count(delim.begin(), delim.end(), equation[i]) == 1) && (i != (eqlength - 1))) { //If the character IS a deliminator...
		tokens.push_back(number); //Add fully-formed number to tokens
		number = ""; //Clear string
		tokens.push_back(charToString(equation[i])); //Add operator to tokens as well
	}
	else if (i == (eqlength - 1)) { //If the for loop is on its last character...
		number.append(charToString(equation[i]));
		tokens.push_back(number);
		number = "";
	}
}
											</code></pre>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>This is the step where we actually begin breaking up the source string into little chunks. Basically, the gist of how this part works is that it iterates through the source string, analyzes each character and classifies them as either a regular character or a deliminator. The <i>number</i> variable created earlier is used for storing temporary string fragments until the algorithm runs into a deliminator. When this happens, it saves the contents of <i>number</i> to a token, erases all content in <i>number</i>, skips over the deliminator and starts again. This process is repeated until the entire string has been iterated through. The third <code>if</code> statement is in regards to the special case where the iteration is nearing its end, and so a slight modification is applied to the usual behaviour.</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<p>The third and final step is really straightforward: take the vector that all of the tokens generated in step 2 are stored in, and return that as the output of the function.</p>
										</div>
										<div class="column" style="width:50%">
											<pre><code>
//Step 3: Return all of the pieces in a string vector as the output of the function.
return tokens;
											</code></pre>
										</div>
									</div>

									<h3 class="major" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>I know that this algorithm isn't a super impressive project on its own. However, it's a small piece in a much bigger project that I will be working on in the future. As I make more progress on that project, I will post here. In the mean time, I have linked a download to the algorithm below.</p>
