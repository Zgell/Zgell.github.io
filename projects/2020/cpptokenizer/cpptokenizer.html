									<h3 class="major" id="intro">Introduction</h3>
									<p>The story for this project begins on July 4th, 2020. A friend of mine introduced me to a concept in programming that I had never heard of called "esoteric programming languages". I'd explain it further, but I feel like the official definition listed on Wikipedia does it best:</p>
									<blockquote>An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke.</blockquote>
									<p>In a nutshell, an esoteric programming language is just a really bizarre programming language. The reason these stuck out to me is because I had always thought about how making my own programming language would be a really cool project in the future, but I felt like I was never ready enough to take on such a task. However, after digging into esoteric programming languages a bit and getting a much better understanding of what a programming language can be, I figured that it wouldn't be impossible for me to try my hand at such a language.</p>
									<p>Originally, an esoteric language was going to be my project for July of 2020, but as you might be able to imagine, it's pretty difficult to plan out, code, test and finish an entire programming language within the span of a month (even if it's a relatively simple one). I really wanted to do something creative with the structure of the language, and as a result I became really indecisive with how I was going to structure the language. That is why this month's project is something as small as a tokenizer algorithm and not a big and grand project like a programming language. This tokenizer that I am writing about today was a piece of my currently unfinished language's interpreter (yes, it was meant to be an interpreted language, not a compiled one).</p>
									<p>Anyways, the goal of this little script is to take in a string of text as a source, along with another string of operators (known as the <i>deliminators</i>) to create a vector of strings that are split based on the deliminators. This is a necessary component of the language interpreter as it allows me to take in a line of the code, split it up by some arbitrary syntax and then have a much easier time interpreting the code and performing the corresponding actions.</p>

									<h3 class="major" id="history">Project History</h3>
									<p>Given that this particular algorithm was started and finished within the span of 5 days, it does not a super detailed history. Therefore I'll keep this short.</p>
