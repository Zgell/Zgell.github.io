											<p>Although this project is a bit of a strange one given that it was made in MATLAB and not a more appropriate programming language, there are a lot of things that led me to making this. I was looking for a more challenging project to create with MATLAB so I could further refine my skills with it. I wanted to explore the world of neural networks a bit further and expand my understanding of the core mechanics behind them. Although the project was started and finished across the span of 4 days, this project took a long time. In those 4 days I probably spent 2-4 hours a day working on it on average. There was a ridiculous amount of troubleshooting I had to go through, that I will elaborate on a bit later. But after a lot of work, I got what appears to be a functional product that passed the test I set for it. I have not implemented this model on a larger scale as of yet, and I am not sure if it would even be worth it to attempt to scale it up. Overall, the project served as an interesting learning experience and as an interesting visualization of the internal mathematics of basic neural networks.</p>

											<p>The foundation of this project came from <a href="https://github.com/jonasbostoen/simple-neural-network/blob/master/main.py" target="_blank">an interesting Python script</a> I ran into around a year ago when I was first interesting in getting some experience in Python with machine learning. I wasn't really sure where to begin with such a complex task, and so I started by looking at some tutorials on YouTube. I found a few basic machine learning models that I spent some time copying, deconstructing and trying to recreate through my own methods. I did come up with what turned out to be a very similar solution to the one in the video, which was a single-neuron neural network that was useful only for demonstrations of the mathematics and concepts behind machine learning. My recreation of that script served as the rough structure of how I went about creating a similar neural network in MATLAB, as the concepts of machine learning were still not 100% solidified in my brain at the time.</p>

									<p>Before I get too far into my solution for how I made a basic neural network in MATLAB, I just wanted to clarify that unlike some of my other projects, I don't plan to explain the science of what's going on too deeply here. This page isn't supposed to be a resource for learning about machine learning, but rather just a documentation of how I went about completing this task.</p>								

									<h3 class="major" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>Ultimately, this was an interesting experiment for a few different reasons. This served as a great example to compare and contrast MATLAB with Python, and how they handle certain mathematical operations differently. Despite the fact that MATLAB is more mathematically focused and properly treats a matrix as a matrix (and not as a list of lists like Python does), that can actually prove to be problematic in certain instances. I'm still a little disappointed that the only way to apply the dot product operation to a matrix in MATLAB is by iterating through the rows, but until I find a better solution, that's how I'll have to do it. I also found it really meaningful to visualize what some of the internal operations (such as the error function and the weight plot) are doing as the calculations progress.</p>
