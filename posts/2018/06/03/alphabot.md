description: "My biggest robotics project from high school"
public: true
---
While this isn't the first robotics project I've tackled throughout my life, this one is probably the most impressive high school project I've worked on.
This project took a fair bit of work and was probably the first Python program I wrote that I was genuinely proud of, even if it doesn't stand up compared to some of my other work nowadays.
