description: "A modified version of a popular raytracing program."

This project is a modified version of the raytracing program in Peter Shirley's "Raytracing in One Weekend" book. I was interested in following along with this tutorial to learn more about the raytracing algorithm as well as keep my C++ skills sharp. Following along one-for-one with the tutorial was nice, but I wanted to make a modified version with some performance optimizations, so that's what I did.
