Following my previous two attempts at implementing John Conway's Game of Life, I felt a little disappointed with the lack of interactivity with the game. It always looks like so much fun to be able to directly modify the board. Also, you can search online and find lots of discovered shapes that people have found that have certain behaviors, and it's fascinating to me that such shapes have been found. I wanted a version of the game that let you experiment with these patterns for yourself. Around this time, I was also learning a library known as "p5.js", which lets you create interactive canvases in JavaScript. This led to the major idea of this project: implement the Game of Life as a p5.js canvas.
