This is a small Python program I wrote during the beginning of the pandemic right after my school year had ended. This was when the COVID-19 lockdowns were in full effect and people couldn't do much. I decided to spend my time cooped up in my home learning some new programming tricks, and for this project, the focus was on web scraping.
