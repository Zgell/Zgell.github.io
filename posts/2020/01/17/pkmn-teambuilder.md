This was my first attempt at an algorithm that I still, to this day, have yet to see a proper implementation of. I've always had the idea of a smart tool that competitive Pokemon players could use to design a team that would have good synergy, and this algorithm was a very primitive attempt at generating good type matchups for a team.

In the future, I'd like to revisit this program using either machine learning techniques or some kind of genetic algorithm. I can absolutely see how a genetic algorithm could be used to determine team typing in a way that generates teams that have very few weaknesses.
