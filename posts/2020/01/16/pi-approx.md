description: "A fun little MATLAB script for calculating the digits of pi."
public: false

This project began shortly after I started my ENCMP 100 (or Engineering Computer Programming) course in university. The programming language used in the course is MATLAB, a math-focused language that I unfortunately had no prior experience with. Given this lack of experience, I decided that doing a few extra projects on top of my coding assignments might be a fun idea that would also give me enough experience with MATLAB to enter the faculty's programming competition. This particular script is the very first project I started and finished in MATLAB. It isn't too complex or interesting, but I learned a lot about some of the mathematical theories regarding the approximation of pi while trying to make this.
