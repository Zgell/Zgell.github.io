description: "Another fun MATLAB one-off for playing around with a basic neural network."

Although this project is a bit of a strange one given that it was made in MATLAB and not a more appropriate programming language, there are a lot of things that led me to making this. I was looking for a more challenging project to create with MATLAB so I could further refine my skills with it. I wanted to explore the world of neural networks a bit further and expand my understanding of the core mechanics behind them. Although the project was started and finished across the span of 4 days, this project took a long time. In those 4 days I probably spent 2-4 hours a day working on it on average. There was a ridiculous amount of troubleshooting I had to go through, that I will elaborate on a bit later. But after a lot of work, I got what appears to be a functional product that passed the test I set for it. I have not implemented this model on a larger scale as of yet, and I am not sure if it would even be worth it to attempt to scale it up. Overall, the project served as an interesting learning experience and as an interesting visualization of the internal mathematics of basic neural networks.
