<h2>So... why did you make this?</h2>
<p>Have you ever seen a project on the internet so interesting that you knew you had to recreate it? That is literally the only reason I made this project. I saw a YouTube tutorial showing off how to make a $5 &quot;wifi jammer&quot; device and I was immediately interested in it. I wasn't interested in using it for anything actually nefarious, but I did want to play around with it a bit just to know that it was <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, this project isn't too interesting. It basically boils down to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy an ESP8266</li>
<li>Program it to disrupt WiFi networks</li>
<li>And that's it...?</li>
</ol>
<p>I really wish there was more to say about this project, but there isn't. I successfully purchased an ESP8266 board, successfully flashed it with the software, and successfully created a device that could send deauthentication frames to nearby WiFi networks.</p>
<p>I also should clarify that despite me building this device, I never actually used it for anything malicious. I have a habit (and still do to this day) of becoming intrigued with projects with massive potential for chaos, building/designing them, and then never unleashing them because it goes against my better judgement. I think it's more about interest than any sort of malice or intent to use them, but beyond that I cannot explain why I was so interested in a project I ultimately had no intention of using.</p>
