<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I have a friend who streams regularly on Twitch. He plays a variety of video games on his stream. To let his audience know what he plans to stream for the week, he puts out a schedule each week to let his audience know what to expect.
These schedules came in the form of a sort of infographic that he would post in his Discord server. He used to make these schedules manually each week and would spend 20-30 minutes on each one.</p>
<p>After talking about his schedules with him, I got the idea to try and write a program for him that would automate the heavy lifting of making these schedules. The key requirements were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program has to make it easier/faster to create the schedules.</li>
<li>Setup has to be very simple: as simple as running the program and entering in the information.</li>
<li>Has to be able to show the box art of the game(s) schedule for the week.</li>
<li>Has to be able to produce an image that's good to go as-is (ie. no other steps).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>TODO</p>
<p>The project was a success! The program can create an entire schedule in about 15 seconds.</p>
<ul>
<li>Interacts with IGDB API to get the box art of any game</li>
<li>Uses a template image I created from old schedules and fills them out with box art from IGDB</li>
<li>Written in Python, but I used Py2EXE to convert it into a standalone EXE.</li>
</ul>
