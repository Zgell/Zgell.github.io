                            PyTerminal is a basic terminal emulator I created using Qt and its Python bindings.
                            This started because of a project I undertook at a previous job where I was working with a Qt application and wanted to integrate a terminal into it.

            <h2>PyTerminal</h2>
            <p>
                The idea for PyTerminal originated from a project I was working on at a previous job.
                Without going into too much detail, I was writing a GUI application in Python using Qt.
                I needed to create my own terminal widget for the application that could read data packets and print out their contents so they could be analyzed in real time.
                At first this seemed like a really daunting task, but it turns out that in Qt it's much easier than you'd think.
                One nice thing about Qt is the ability to create subclasses of the existing widgets and make custom variants for specific tasks.
                I made a custom variant of a textbox widget that was coloured to look like a terminal, removed all of the user input functionality,
                and could be updated using custom external signals. It was a little hacky but it turned out well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward a few months and I had been obsessed with the idea of creating the "perfect terminal" for programming.
                Obviously many have tried, as there are lots of free terminals out there on the internet to download and use.
                Given I had no experience in writing terminals, I wasn't expecting that I would be the one to write the best one.
                I decided that it might be interesting to learn about how to actually make a really basic one.
            </p>
            <p>
                After some preliminary research I found that there were many techniques one could use to make a terminal.
                Some of the fancier implementations I had seen used OpenGL/some other graphics library and rendered it through the GPU for better performance and more varied visuals.
                I wanted to pick something simple since I only had limited GUI programming experience, and then I remembered that project I did in Qt for my previous job.
                It <i>kind of</i> worked, and I bet that with some tweaks you could make that into a feasible terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
                It turns out that buildign the basic prototype was really easy and only took about 100 lines of code.
                Since I was building a terminal emulator and not a shell, I didn't have to define any of the commands myself.
                I was basically just building a windowed application that acted as a middleman between the user and the shell program (ie. CMD on Windows).
                Qt has built-in routines for running other programs as sub-routines within it and integrating it into the Qt multithreading system.
                All I needed to do to make a functioning prototype was to integrate a shell (such as CMD.exe from Windows) into this process and feed its output through a window.
                Turns out that this process is pretty simple and didn't really require a ton of troubleshooting either. It just sort of worked!
            </p>
            <p>This left me with a basic Qt application that looked like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A basic window containing only one widget: a custom subclass of the default text box</li>
                <li>This custom text box was stylized to look like a terminal, and was connected to the subprocess that ran <code>cmd.exe</code></li>
                <li>Since the subprocess also handles input, I didn't need to modify much in the terminal to handle input either.</li>
            </ul>
