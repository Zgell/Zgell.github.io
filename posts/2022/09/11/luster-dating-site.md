Luster is a dating app created for the 2022 ShellHacks hackathon. I participated in a group consisting of myself and 4 other programmers to see what we could come up with in 48 hours. Since the project was an extremely ambitious idea for a hackathon, we were not able to finish everything we hoped to achieve with it. However, we may continue developing it in the future for the sake of completeness.
