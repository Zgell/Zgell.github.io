## Intro

I should preface this project with a bit of context to describe *why* this project was so significant to me. When I created this project, I was 14 years old. Prior to this project, I had no experience with non-software projects. I started programming around the age of 10, because I developed an interest in learning how to make video games. Every pure software project I did at this time was somehow motivated by gaming.

Around this time I had started to develop an interest in game emulation. I was fascinated with all of these historic video game titles that had come out before my time, and I wanted to give them a try. Around this time there was plenty of good emulation programs freely available on the internet. However, I believe it was a YouTube video I stumbled across all those years ago that introduced me to the Raspberry Pi, and more importantly at the time, the RetroPie project. There was just something about the idea of having an all-in-one games console that could play games from all sorts of generations of game systems that was extremely appealing to me. To a kid with no other exposure to emulation, the idea of a "super console" that could play any video game imaginable sounded like the kind of thing kids would dream about. In retrospect, it's no surprise that once I heard about such a project, I **had** to get my hands on one.

And so began my journey into the world of Raspberry Pis, and by extension, computer engineering as a whole.

## The Project

This project started around the time I discovered the RetroPie project and learned about Raspberry Pi computers as a whole. RetroPie is a special installation of the Raspbian OS for Raspberry Pi single-board computers that lets you turn a Raspberry Pi into a dedicated retro gaming console. This project was fascinating to me, and this is what ultimately led me to buy my first Raspberry Pi. I didn't care that I could do basically the same thing on my laptop by installing EmulationStation, I just wanted a dedicated console for retro gaming. It didn't matter if it was practical, *it just sounded cool*.

This project is honestly very straightforward and not that impressive from this point onward. I basically ordered a Raspberry Pi 2B, a microSD card and some Logitech F310 gamepads. I installed RetroPie on the SD card, inserted it into the Raspberry Pi and booted it up for the first time. Unsurprisingly, it worked! From there, I got my hands on some ROMs for old games and started playing.

The only reason this project is of note is because it marks the first hardware-related project I ever attempted, aside from some minor robotics stuff with those Lego Mindstorms kits. It wasn't too deep into any *actual* hardware design since it was literally just buying a computer and programming it, but the important thing is that it included a physical element to a project that I simply had never done before.

## The Aftermath

It's normal to be left wondering why I have a section titled "The Aftermath" on what is probably my most innocuous and uninteresting project. The only reason I am including this section is because this project had a surprising impact on my school life after I created it. I brought it into school one day to show it off, as I had been talking to some friends about it. Everyone seemed pretty interested in it, so we found some time to head over to our school's library to hook it up to the projector and test it out. The librarian was cool with us doing this, and we'd spend our lunch breaks playing some retro video games together in the library which was a lot of fun. Over time, the word about this project got out and people started talking about us. If I'm being totally honest, it got way more attention than what was warranted. It was literally just a Raspberry Pi and a program that I installed on it, but I guess no one else really knew about that part.

There was this one group of visitors (I do not know exactly *why* they came or what their official title would even be) our school had that were coming from another city, and a number of students were putting together presentations for them to show off some of the cool projects that the students were involved in. My homeroom teacher basically forced me into this, so I had to present in front of them. The project was pretty well received, although I could tell they weren't tech people.

Also, I got some school-wide attention for the PRISM as well. At my school, we would always hold an end-of-year assembly to summarize how the school year went. In the past couple of years, they started giving away these awards to a small handful (about half a dozen) students who were "exceptional" at something. These topics ranged from things like creativity, community engagement and so on. I discovered that the invention of this project led to me winning the "Innovation" award at my school, which I thought was pretty neat. I think that the positive feedback I got for this project, even if debatably unwarranted, definitely encouraged me to explore more hardware-focused projects in the future. I think it's safe to say that while this project wasn't substantial on its own, it had a pretty large impact on the direction that I would take in the future.

Also, about the name: the "PRISM". I think it was an acronym but I cannot remember what it stood for. Probably something cringe to be honest, but I don't know. I suspect I just wanted a cool-sounding acronym and came up with the actual name afterwards, and "PRISM" must have been the best I could come up with at the time.
