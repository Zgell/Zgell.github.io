            <h1>What's Next?</h1>

            <p>
                Generally, I like to keep working on projects year-round as I have lots of cool ideas for things I want to try, and I want to get through some of them before I keep piling more on my ever-growing list.
                I try to follow a loose month-by-month project schedule where I assign a project for 1-3 months depending on length and try to get as much done in that time frame as I can.
                I'll report the results here, successful or not, so that even if a project is failure something can be learned from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't make any guarantees, but the following is a tentative look at what I think I will be working on next:
