									<h3 class="major" id="todo">To-Do List</h3>
									<p>This page will list some of the ideas for projects that I would like to try in the future. Some of them are really ambitious and may never get finished, but the list serves as a guideline for some of the projects I should at least attempt.</p>
									<p>The list below is in no particular order, I have only numbered it so that readers can get a sense for how many project ideas I have.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Upgraded Retro Gaming Console
											<ul>
												<li>A twist on an old project I made when I was 13 years old. I created a mini retro gaming console using a Raspberry Pi and a program called "RetroPie", which allowed the Raspberry Pi to emulate a bunch of old ROMs. Ever since I made that console, I've wanted to make a more powerful one that can run emulators for newer consoles since the Raspberry Pi (at the time) did not have a lot of raw compute power.</li>
												<li>One approach I've thought of would be to take an ARM-based chromebook, gut it and use the base system as it has 8 CPU cores and most likely a more powerful GPU. I could also use the screen for something else (like a DIY monitor to go with it).</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Advanced version of Conway's "Game of Life" Simulation
											<ul>
												<li>Literally just a simulation of the popular cellular automaton "Game of Life" but with some extra features</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Microwave Gun
											<ul>
												<li>May or may not do this one due to a number of problems (health and safety, cost, ethics) but it's still one that has piqued my interests.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Coilgun, Railgun or a combination of the two
											<ul>
												<li>The hybrid design I have in mind is a coilgun design to get the projectile moving initially after being chambered, and then the railgun barrel component would accelerate the projectile.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Bioreactor
											<ul>
												<li>I'd like to grow some bioluminescent bacteria as an experiment, if not for decoration.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Custom Hydroponic Garden
											<ul>
												<li>I'd love to use something like an Arduino to automate a garden for a summer project. It might also be fun to make it solar-powered and completely autonomous.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Arc Lighter
											<ul>
												<li>I think having an electric igniter is pretty cool and I'd like to try my hand at making one to see if it's any more useful than a regular lighter. I've seen people making them online but I've never seen a comparison between the two kinds.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>3D Chess Simulation
											<ul>
												<li>I know that 3D chess is a thing that has been created, but I'm unaware of any software simulations of this game. I would like to create one to get a grip on both graphics and also creating a smart "AI" to play against.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>3D LED Cube
											<ul>
												<li>It would be a neat little decoration for my desk or something. It could also be neat to have a 3D version of a cellular automaton going on it.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Something to do with CRISPR technology
											<ul>
												<li>This could relate to the bioreactor project, but I think that doing a small experiment with CRISPR would be really neat.</li>
												<li>This is one of those things that's really hard right now but in the future may be more accessible, so it's not exactly at the top of my priorities list.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A custom 4-Bit/8-Bit CPU
											<ul>
												<li>It would be a lot of fun to design a custom computer system from the ground up, although it would be a complicated task.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Crude Radio Circuit
											<ul>
												<li>I think that building a small crude radio would be a great experiment to learn more about circuits (which at the moment I am not very experienced with).</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A High-Power Laser
											<ul>
												<li>Although I'd want it mostly for fun, there's a lot that you can do with a powerful laser.</li>
												<li>It's possible that I may use this as an anti-bird defense system for my house as at my current home we have some issues with the magpies that live around here.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>ESP8266-Powered Digital Weather and Environment Display System
											<ul>
												<li>I really like the ESP8266 processor and I'd like to make much more with it than just a little Wi-Fi device. I think that a weather display would be an easy and practical device that would also give me experience with screens and such.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Directional Speaker / "Sound Laser"
											<ul>
												<li>I could see a lot of use for a device that allows you to broadcast sound to a specific area, and I have several ideas for projects that come from it. But for now, the speaker itself would be interesting enough to do.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Robot, Powered by an Arduino or a Raspberry Pi
											<ul>
												<li>I'd like more experience with robotics and some basic robot with either of these devices would be great for that. I've also wanted to have a general-purpose robot for other projects and automation stuff.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Dedicated Server Computer
											<ul>
												<li>There's several reasons I'd want a proper server computer, but some of the main ones are for running private servers for friends in video games or for handling cloud-based applications.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Discord Bot Expansion
											<ul>
												<li>I've made a few basic Discord bots in the past using the <code>Discord.py</code> library, but I'd also like to make a fully-featured one that could be used in a server.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Graphene Synthesis
											<ul>
												<li>Graphene is a material that I find really interesting, and I'd love to be able to make even a crude sample of it just to play around with it. Synthesizing some very crude stuff doesn't seem terribly difficult.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A 4D Game/Graphical Engine
											<ul>
												<li>My main inspiration for this idea was a game called "Miegakure", which was a game that took place in 4 spatial dimensions that was never released. I think that making my own attempt at such a system would be very interesting.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Voxel Engine for a Minecraft Clone
											<ul>
												<li>I'd be interested in making a Minecraft clone in order to understand how to optimize voxel-based engines, world generation, and noise algorithms.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>An Emulator for the NES or for the Commodore 64
											<ul>
												<li>Writing an emulator in C++ would be a really great experiment for me to understand basic computer systems as well as strengthen my knowledge in complex C++ programs.</li>
												<li>One of my choices for this project would be the NES as it's one of the most fun systems to emulate in my opinion as it has a good selection of classic video games.</li>
												<li>The other system I'd like to try to emulate would be the Commodore 64, which I have a personal connection with since I inherited one from my late grandparents.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>An AI-Based Card Game.
											<ul>
												<li>How it would work is that we would use those old custom Pokemon cards that were popular around 2010 as the source. The program would pull a bunch of random images from the internet and use an AI program to turn those into playable cards (it would generate stats and attacks for each card) that would be used in a card game.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Turning a Mobile VR Headset into a Proper VR Headset
											<ul>
												<li>I got a mobile VR headset from my parents one christmas, and as neat as it is, it's not terribly useful and is definitely dwarfed by all of the PC headsets. However, I think that you could turn one of these headsets into a decent PC headset for casual use as long as you wrote the write software for it and added the right hardware.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Music Streaming Service and/or App
											<ul>
												<li>I came up with this idea from all of the frustrations I had suffered from platforms such as Spotify and Soundcloud. I thought it would be a neat experiment that would build my experience in web stuff if I were to come up with my own solution for music.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>My Own Cryptographic Algorithm
											<ul>
												<li>I want to make a really unique cryptographic algorithm for obscuring information, and since the format will be very different and obscure, most people will not know how to crack it.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>A Minecraft Mod
											<ul>
												<li>A mod for Minecraft would be great as it is a video game that I really enjoyed as a kid, but it's also a really good task to practice my skills in the Java programming language.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
