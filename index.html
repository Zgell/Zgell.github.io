    <h1>Zach's Project Repository</h1>

    
<br/>
<p>
  My name is Zach. I'm a computer engineer who enjoys working on all sorts of software and hardware projects.
  This website was created as a way to keep track of all the projects I've worked on.
  Each of the pages includes the story behind each project, the design of the project as well as the process to create it,
  some of the more interesting details, and finally how the project turned out.
  This website is still a work-in-progress, as I have worked on many projects over many years and am still recovering 
  some of the documentation for the older projects.
</p>
<p>
  The projects found on this website do not represent every engineering project I've ever worked on, and
  you won't be able to find documentation for everything I've ever worked on either.
  Instead, this website is focused more on documenting my personal projects that I work on in my spare time.
</p>
<p>I hope you find some of the projects I've worked on interesting!</p></br>
